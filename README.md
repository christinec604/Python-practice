# My Python Learning Journey

## Overview

This repository documents my learning journey through a Python basics tutorial. 
As a beginner in Python programming, I've gone through various exercises and examples to grasp the fundamental concepts of Python.
This repository serves as a personal record of what I've learned and practiced.

## What I Learned

**• Basic Syntax**: Started with the classic "Hello World" and progressed to understand the structure of Python code.<br>
**• Data Types**: Explored strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and dictionaries, understanding how to use them in Python.<br>
**• String Operations**: Learned how to manipulate strings with slicing, concatenation, and formatting.<br>
**• Conditional Statements**: Gained insight into using if-else statements in different scenarios.<br>
**• Lists and Loops**: Understood how to create lists, access list elements, and iterate over them using loops.<br>
**• Functions**: Learned about defining and calling functions, understanding the basics of function parameters and return values.<br>
**• Using Modules**: Got introduced to importing and using modules like math to perform various mathematical operations.<br>

## Key Exercises

• Creating and manipulating different data types.<br>
• Implementing conditional logic to solve simple real-world problems.<br>
• Using for loops to iterate through lists and perform operations.<br>
• Building simple functions for repetitive tasks.<br>

## Reflections

Throughout this tutorial, I've enhanced my understanding of Python and programming fundamentals. 
Each exercise challenged me to think critically and apply the concepts learned in a practical manner.

## Future Goals

• To delve deeper into more advanced Python topics like classes and file handling.<br>
• To start working on small personal projects to apply these basics in real-world scenarios.<br>
• To learn about Python frameworks and libraries for web development and data analysis.<br>

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank the creators of the original Python tutorial for providing a comprehensive and beginner-friendly guide.
