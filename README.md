# My Python Learning Journey

## 👀 Overview

This repository showcases my learning in basic Python programming concepts, featuring simple exercises and data visualization practice.

## 👩🏻‍💻 Key Exercises

**• Basic Syntax**: Started with "Hello World" and grasped the structure of Python code.<br>
**• Data Types**: Explored and utilized strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and dictionaries in Python.<br>
**• String Operations**: Learned how to manipulate strings with slicing, concatenation, and formatting.<br>
**• Conditional Statements**: Practiced if-else statements with simple real-life scenarios.<br>
**• Lists and Loops**: Understood how to create lists, access list elements, and iterate over them with loops.<br>
**• Functions**: Learned how to define and call functions, understanding the basics of function parameters and return values.<br>
**• Using Modules**: Got introduced to importing and using modules like math to perform various mathematical operations.<br>
**• Word Cloud Generation**: Created word clouds with custom configurations such as background color, dimensions, and word limits.<br>
**• Stopwords Handling**: Incorporated a list of stopwords to exclude common words for more meaningful visualizations.<br>
**• Visualization with Matplotlib**: Used Matplotlib to display the generated word clouds.<br>
